# NewsX
This is a news website  made using Node.js with Express.js and MongoDB. It ready data from an external news api and renders it on the browser. Here, we have used ejs as
the template for this project.

1. After you have cloned the git repository, open it using any text editor. Then open the Command Prompt and go to the directory NewsX. You may also use the terminal
   which comes with some nice text editors like VS Code, Atom etc. After doing so, type "npm install" to install all the dependencies into the environment. If any error
   occurs, you might need to install Node.js from https://nodejs.org/en/ and npm comes with it.
2. After doing so, in the terminal, type "npm start" to start the server. Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000/ . You will see this.
3. From here, you can register yourself and then login to reach the dashboard to read he latest news.
4. The Settings tab contain option for you, to logout or delete your account.

Have Fun ;)
